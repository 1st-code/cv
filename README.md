          <p><h3>2010, a business has invested millions in creating an ecosystem for virtual reality technology marketed towards the consumer gaming market</h3></p>
          <p><strong>Due to limits of technology, the product's adoption has slowed due to poor uptake, stemming from focusing on console-style gaming controllers and other factors.</strong></p><br>
          <ul>
            <strong>Possible problems:</strong>
            <br><br>
            <li>Motion detection</li>
            <li>Controller</li>
            <li>Multimedia</li>
            <br><br>
            <strong>Possible solution:</strong>
            <br><br>
            <li>The primary market are PC users, rather than force them to use a clunky console-style controller:-<br>
            <li><p><strong>Create a product that would facilitate a more streamlined control style</strong></p></li>

		Most laptops have a webcam. Most users in the target demographic have a smartphone.
		
		A small curved mirror with a plastic clip to attach to the front of the webcam that will reflect the keyboard and mouse onto the camera's sensor, otherwise a stand to place a smartphone so the device camera can be used while also doubling as a standard device stand.

		A software program can crop areas of video stream around the keyboard and mouse and render as a semi-transparent and resizeable head-up display while the user wears the virtual reality headset.

		The target demographic can now wear the headset in 3-D simulators and game environments while utilizing standard controls with minimal outside distraction.

		- Cost of production of plastic clip, mirror: < $2
              
		This would also allow game developers to create a DLC upgrade for their finished product.

		Create an ability to look around the neck of the player model when user moves their head. Useful in 3-D environments, flight simulators, first-person shooters.

		In the competitive world of online gaming, quality peripherals are charged at a premium.
								  
		Increasing the player's situational awareness with virtual reality technology while retaining the efficiency of keyboard-mouse controls.

		- Business expands sales of their technology and profits
			
		- 3rd-party developers renew sales of titles and profit

		- Product has utility for consumer.

		- Technology rollout momentum increases
