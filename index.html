          <p><h3>2010. Business A has invested millions in creating an ecosystem for virtual reality technology marketed towards the consumer gaming market</h3></p>
          <p><strong>Due to limits of technology, the product's adoption has slowed due to poor uptake, stemming from focusing on console-style gaming controllers and other factors.</strong></p>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <strong>Problems:</strong>
            <br><br>
            <li>Motion detection</li>
            <li>Controller</li>
            <li>Multimedia</li>
            <br><br>
            <strong>Solution<sup>1</sup>:</strong>
            <br><br>
            <li>The primary market are PC users, rather than force them to use a clunky console-style controller:-<br>
              <ul><li><p><strong>Create a product that would facilitate a more streamlined control style</strong></p>

              <p>Most laptops have a webcam. Most users in the target demographic have a smartphone.</p>
              <p>A small curved mirror with a plastic clip to attach to the front of the webcam that will reflect the keyboard and mouse onto the camera's sensor, otherwise a stand to place a smartphone so the device camera can be used while also doubling as a normal device stand.</p>

              <p>A software program can crop areas of video stream around the keyboard and mouse and render as a semi-transparent and resizeable head-up display while the user wears the virtual reality headset.</p>

              <p>The target demographic can now wear the headset in 3-D simulators and game environments while utilizing standard controls with minimal outside distraction.</p>

              <li><p>Cost of production of plastic clip, mirror: < $2</p></li>
              <li><p>Retail price: > $10-$15</p></li>
              
              <p>This would also allow game developers to create a DLC for their finished product to make them [product ready] and even charge a small fee.</p>

              <p>Basically just create an ability to look around the neck of the player model when user moves their head. Useful in 3-D environments, flight simulators, first-person shooters.</p>

              <p>In the competitive world of online gaming, quality peripherals are charged at a premium.</p>
              <p>Increasing the player's situational awareness with virtual reality technology while retaining the efficiency of keyboard-mouse controls.</p></li></li>

              <li><p>Business 'A' expands sales of their technology and profits</p></li>
              <li><p>3rd-party developers renew sales of titles and profit</p></li>
              <li><p>Consumers happy to purchase (product gives them an edge)</p></li>
              <li><p>Technology rollout momentum increases</p></li>
              <li><p>WIN-WIN-WIN</p></li>
              </li></li></ul>
